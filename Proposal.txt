Description of Topic: Graph Algorithms

Reason for Topic Choice: We have both taken CS16 and CS32 where we have implemented Dijkstra's, Prim's and Kurskal's algorithms before so are familiar with the content.

Foundation Goal: Model the algorithms correctly and be able to verify they do what they are supposed to do, i.e. for Prim's/Kruskal's verify that they always produce minimum spanning trees and for Dijkstra's that it always finds the shortest path. 

Target Goal: In addition to the foundation goal, answer the questions of whether or not Prim's and Kruskal's always produce the same spanning tree and provide a situation where Dijkstra's would fail.

Reach Goal: In addition to the reach goal, provide a solution to countering the problem where Dijkstra's would fail with negative edge weights.


NOTES:
how do we prove that the MST is valid? what characteristics

model a MST test it

how to model the algorithms - state or relations

MST Spec + Re-do goals. 

Foundation: Model un/directed graph, be able to identify characteristics of MST and validate a tree is an MST.

Target: Model prim’s/kruskal’s and answer the question if they produce the same MST.

Reach: Use our model to approximate a solution for the NP-Hard traveling salesman problem.
