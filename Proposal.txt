Description of Topic: Graph Algorithms

Reason for Topic Choice: We have both taken CS16 and CS32 where we have implemented Dijkstra's, Prim's and Kurskal's algorithms before so are familiar with the content.

Foundation: Model un/directed graph, be able to identify characteristics of MST and validate a tree is an MST.

Target: Model prim’s/kruskal’s and answer the question if they produce the same MST.

Reach: Use our model to approximate a solution for the NP-Hard traveling salesman problem.

NOTES:
how do we prove that the MST is valid? what characteristics

model a MST test it

how to model the algorithms - state or relations

MST Spec + Re-do goals.
